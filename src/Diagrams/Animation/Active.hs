-- A few utilities and class instances for 'Active' (from the @active@
-- package).  In particular, this module defines
--
--   * An instance of 'V' for 'Active': @'V' ('Active' a) = 'V' a@
--
--   * 'HasOrigin', 'Transformable', and 'HasStyle' instances for
--     'Active' which all work pointwise.
--
--   * A 'TrailLike' instance for @'Active' t@ where @t@ is also
--     'TrailLike', which simply lifts a pathlike thing to an
--     (infinite) constant active value.
--
--   * 'Juxtaposable' instances for @'Active' a@ where @a@ is also
--     'Juxtaposable'.  An active value can be juxtaposed against
--     another by doing the juxtaposition pointwise over time.

-- Yes, these are all orphan instances. Get over it.  We don't want to
-- put them in the 'active' package because 'active' is supposed to be
-- generally useful and shouldn't depend on diagrams.  We'd also
-- rather not put them in diagrams-core so that diagrams-core doesn't
-- have to depend on active.
